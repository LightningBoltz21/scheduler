To understand the complex relationships between environments and recreation, the course applies theories and methodologies developed in the field of environment and behavior—spanning psychology, sociology, urban planning, and landscape architecture. Throughout the course, students discuss how gender, race-ethnicity, and socio-economic status can contribute to shaping the relationships between environments and recreation behaviors.",

Sport development is concerned with the creation and management of systems designed to optimize participation in sport, and the movement of athletes both vertically and horizontally through the sport system. Sport for development focuses on the use of sport to potentially achieve social change and development outcomes at the individual, community, and societal levels. Invariably, these concepts are linked, and one cannot exist without the other. Each module will take an integrative approach and examine sport development and sport for development concurrently, with focus on practical applications of all concepts.",
