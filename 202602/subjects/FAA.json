      "A global course in theorizing Black cultural expression. It surveys artistic and cultural responses to types of racism (racial formations), modes of Black resistance and resiliency, and expressions of Black liberation and self-determination. Topics range from Spirituals, Gospel, and \"ring-shouts\" to Western classical music, ballet and modern dance; from Blues, Jazz, and Hip-Hop to African-inspired architecture and Blues tropes embedded in urban and regional segregationist planning; and from the lineage of Black Art + Design to the power of place of the Black Metropolis. As such, the course attends to the geographies of place and ontologies of time, i.e., moments formed from the intersection of Black social movements against white supremacy and Black reimagining of what it means to be human. Through a series of engagements with faculty-artists and researchers in the College of Fine & Applied Arts, Black Arts Today explores the practice and speculative spaces (imaginaries) in which FAA artists-instructors-researchers engage Black Arts or transmit Blackness to the arts.",
