This course brings together multidisciplinary student teams who will use the human-centered design approach to complete authentic projects. Thematic sections will require the teams to implement design thinking methodologies to conduct research, propose and prototype designs, and plan for the implementation and launch of final designs. Teams will be matched with appropriate advisors for guidance and inspiration.",
