Instructional technologies such as computer-based instruction, computer-based testing, distance learning, interactive video, and intelligent instructional technologies are covered.

What are the possible impacts of contemporary social transformations on teaching and learning - including in the areas of technology, media, globalization, diversity, changing forms of work in the \"knowledge society\", and, in these contexts, changing learner needs and sensibilities? This course explores three pedagogical paradigms: \"didactic\", \"authentic\" and \"transformative\" learning.

State and federal documents will be examined, as will global policy documents including UNESCO’s Education for Sustainable Development: A Roadmap, to better understand the purpose, design, and content of these fields and their impact on people, place, and planet. Meant to prompt curiosity and critical questioning about learning and instruction in formal and informal spaces. We will explore current definitions of sustainability, the role education plays in advancing a sustainable future, and how connections to place can promote stronger systems of education and justice. The course is organized thematically around topics such as the Rationale for Sustainability Education, Theories and Practices of Sustainability Education, Current Global and Local Policy Frameworks, and issues in Sustainability Education and Climate and Social Justice.",
