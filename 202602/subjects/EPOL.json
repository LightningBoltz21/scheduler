State and federal documents will be examined, as will global policy documents including UNESCO’s Education for Sustainable Development: A Roadmap, to better understand the purpose, design, and content of these fields and their impact on people, place, and planet. Meant to prompt curiosity and critical questioning about learning and instruction in formal and informal spaces. We will explore current definitions of sustainability, the role education plays in advancing a sustainable future, and how connections to place can promote stronger systems of education and justice.

To meet these needs, this course covers a wide range of instructional technologies that are used for instructional and administrative purposes. Traditional instructional media are considered in the course although significant emphasis is placed on more recent developments that involve the use of the computer and its applications in education. Instructional technologies such as computer-based instruction, computer-based testing, distance learning, interactive video, and intelligent instructional technologies are covered. Through course readings, discussions, and projects, students in the course are expected to gain skills in choosing appropriate instructional technologies, designing effective presentations that rely on those technologies, and properly using instructional technologies to enhance communication with an audience.",
