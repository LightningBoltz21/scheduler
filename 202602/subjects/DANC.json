This course can also support grad students in their ongoing physical practice. This daily practice of technique teaches the student to perform with clarity, versatility, and personal style, preparing students for the physical rigor associated with a performing career in dance. To provide a balance of training from a range of cultural origins and traditions, this course will include 2-3 contemporary movement approaches per semester, which may include techniques such as Ballet, Capoeira, Contemporary Modern, Hip Hop, House, Improvisation, Jazz, Tap, Umfundalai, West African, etc. Specific dance forms for each semester will be listed in the class schedule.",
