      "Intended for undergraduates who have an interest in creating programs and products that have social values for communities. Features social entrepreneurship as an approach to social development and will consider its application and related change strategies to a wide array of social problems. Social entrepreneurship has emerged as a change approach that features the application of entrepreneurial practices to social ventures. Social entrepreneurship is similar to business entrepreneurship in its emphasis on selected program development and management principles and processes, but social entrepreneurs have the primary goal of creating social value in communities rather than personal or shareholder wealth. The initial part of the class will emphasize instructing students in broad concepts and principles related to entrepreneurship, while the latter portion of the course will feature students working on teams to design social projects.",

Students are expected to use the course material to explore their personal values, biases, family backgrounds, culture, and formative experiences in order to deepen their self-awareness and develop interpersonal skills in bridging differences. Finally, students apply learning from the course to identify characteristics of effective social work and other health and human service provision among people culturally different themselves; and to identify opportunities for change contributing to prejudice reduction and cross-cultural acceptance at home, work and in society.",
